# AQI-prediction-model
Developed a machine learning-based model to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) using historical air quality data. The system analyzes past pollutant levels to forecast future AQI trends, helping users understand potential health risks and environmental conditions in advance.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, CSV/JSON datasets
